# !1010!

## Background

!1010! is an easy-to-learn and highly addictive puzzle game that's inspired by *1010!*. The game is similar to Tetris, but unique in that you can manipulate the Tetris-style blocks at your own pace. The rules are simple: (1) Combine puzzle blocks in order to build and destroy full lines vertically and horizontally and (2) Don't let the puzzle blocks fill up the grid.

## Functionality & MVP

Users will be able to:
- [ ] Start, pause, and reset the game
- [ ] Select blocks (from 3 given blocks that must be used until 3 new blocks are given) and place them anywhere on the grid

This project will also include:
- [ ] An About modal describing the background and rules of the game
- [ ] A production README
